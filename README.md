# Birthday-Paradox
This is assigment was done by Gehad Mohamed, ID 900132290, for the class CSCE310201 Programming in Java. In this assignment random sets were generated 
and the goal was to inspect how many times would it take to pull the same number twice from the set. This experiement 
was conducted for many times and on many set sizes where the number of both is specified by the user.
After this Experiement, minimum, maximum, average and mean were calculated and plotted on a graph when needed.

The implementation was mainly using Birthday Paradox class where HashMap was utilized to minimize the process of insuring no duplicates exist in a set. 
Moreover, the class statistics was utilized in the statistics generation and where no extra memory storage ( arrays & ect.) was used.
